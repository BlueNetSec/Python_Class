= 17C Python

== 1.0 Course Description:

Python has become an important tool in the skillset of every IT Security professional.  Python’s usefulness in rapidly developing custom tools and prototypes has resulted in many IT Security teams possessing an assortment of specialized scripts designed to meet ad-hoc security requirements.  As such, it is common for team members to be faced with undocumented and often poorly maintained scripts that are essential for project operations.  As such, every security professional should possess the ability to understand and modify scripts crafted by others.

== 1.1 Course Goals and Outcomes:

This course will focus on developing the student’s ability to read and modify pre-existing Python scripts.  Students will start out by being presented with some basic Python programming challenges to re-introduce some of the basic Python structures and concepts.  They will be introduced to working with Python modules and getting them to function correctly with pre-existing scripts.  Python modules will be followed by Python script structures, where the students will write their own small scripts to solve data manipulation challenges.
Following the basics of Python lessons, students will be presented with script shells representing IT Security related tools.  Students will be required to assess the shell programs to understand the desired program flow and outcome.  They will then be required to fill out the shells to complete the programs.  This will introduce numerous Python modules to the students they will need to research to get the programs functioning correctly.
Finally, the students will be exposed to larger Python programs representing IT Security tools.  Students will be shown how to use IDE based debugging to track down errors in the code.  They will be expected to be able to determine the cause of the errors, and then modify the programs to get them functioning correctly.

== 1.3 Assessment Overview:
Where ever possible, exercises will result in a key (typically a SHA1) for the students to discover when completing it successfully.  Students will submit these keys as proof of completion.
At the end of the course, students will be presented with a 20 – 25 questions multiple choice learning assessment.  The questions will cover material from the course, with an emphasis on predicting code output and debugging errors.
