Exercise 1_2: Whose source is this anyways?

Exercise Summary:
Often, packages that you want to use within your Python scripts will not be added to PyPI.  In these cases, it is important to be able to install directly from the source code.

Learning Objectives:
1.1.2.	 Installing from source
1.1.3.	 PYTHONPATH

Narrative:
Follow the instructions:

Instructions:
1)	Using the source code provided, install the module and get ex1_2_1.py to function
2)  Clone the evtx module from repo at 'https://github.com/williballenthin/python-evtx'.  Install the module to run ex1_2_2.py
3)  Put ex1_2_3_module.py into a subfolder named 'modules'.  Run ex1_2_3.py from the parent folder.  Does this work?  What methods can be used to call a module from a sub folder?

Materials:
1)	ex1_2_1.py
2)  ex1_2_1_nmap.tar.gz
3)  ex1_2_2.py
4)  ex1_2_2_log.evtx
4)  ex1_2_3.py
5)  ex1_2_3_module.py

Instructor Notes:

1)  ex1_2_1.py is a simple script that checks to see if students installed the nmap python package.  The package is provided in the tar file.  After untaring the file, students can install it with python setup.py install.  When they run the ex1_2_1.py script, they will get the hash: f131fa0c7c86aa9253a5c879bd0fa2c5176ba8b8

2)  For ex1_2_2.py, students need to install the module off the git repo provided for the Evtx parser.  They can then run the parser against the ex1_2_2_log.evtx log file.  This is the first time students are introduced to function calls and argparse which we will go into in more detail later in the course.  The hash is: 8d396f9047754b91e68d992920b521280cd9d351

3)  For ex1_2_3.py there are two python files.  The main ex1_2_3.py references an import from modules.ex1_2_3_module.  To get this to function correctly, students need to create a modules subfolder and an __init__.py file.  Then place the ex1_2_3_module.py file into that folder.
