Exercise 1_7: It’s only cool if it starts with an ‘i’

Exercise Summary:
One of the best features of Python is it's ability to load up an interactive console to interpret live commands input direct from the user.  However, the standard interactive Python console is a featureless environment lacking much in the way of user accessibility commands.  To improve upon this, many python developers install iPython, which is a full featured Python interactive console environment.

Learning Objectives:
1.4.	iPython


Narrative:
As you explore Python libraries and delve further into programming in the Python language, having a test bed for exactly how to work with new object types while writing scripts is a very useful tool to have at your disposal.  iPython gives us that opportunity.  In this exercise, we will explore some of the features of iPython and discuss ways that this tool can be used to expediate development of much larger scripting programs.

Instructions:
1)	Create a new conda environment named 'ex1_7'
2)  install iPython
3)  Explore the iPython tutorial found in the reference material.  Pick one feature of iPython and discuss it with the rest of the class
4)  Load up script ex1_7_1.py into an iPython interactive shell.  Execute the get_key function.

Materials:
1)	ex1_7_1.py
