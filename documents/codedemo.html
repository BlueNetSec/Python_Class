<p>Using Python, choose one of the options below. You may approach your design either top-down or bottom-up. Explain the functional decomposition and identify which parts of the code (if any) you did not write.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For code that is not your own, provide a citation as an inline comment following the IEEE citation reference format (most likely you will want to use the online sources examples):</p>

<p>You will submit your code on blackboard and present it on the afternoon of Day 5. Plan no more than 5-7 minutes total, with around 3 minutes of explanation and 2-4 minutes of demonstrating the code.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Examples of high aptitude in learning or in depth of knowledge and ability in Python will be recommended for recognition on the course Academic Evaluation Report.</p>

<p>Create a pop up that, once the user accepts, downloads a payload from a python server. Write a key logger payload.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a password cracker that attacks FTP servers, SSH logins, and password-protected files</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encrypt and decrypt a file using the XOR cipher with a many-time-pad key of any length. Read an input file in binary, perform XOR on each byte, and write the encrypted output to a separate file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encode and decode a file depending on user input. Your program will take two inputs, one for file and the other for algorithm type, and will output a new file. The user may select from 5-10 different baseX algorithms (base2, base16, base32, base64, etc)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write a web scraping program that, given a link, downloads the contents of the website and repeats the process for all clickable links in the webpage. The program will store individual output files per site in an organized directory structure. The program should acknowledge (but not investigate) repeat links.</p>

<p>If possible, comment out the code that does not work and demonstrate the functionally decomposed parts that do work.</p>
